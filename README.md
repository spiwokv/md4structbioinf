# Molecular dynamics simulation tutorial for Structural biology 

The aim of this tutorial is to learn molecular dynamics simulation. Tryptophane cage (or Trp-cage, 1L2Y) is
an artificial miniprotein (20 residues) derived from venom of *Gila monster*. Despite its small size it folds
into a compact structure. This folding is super-fast compared to regular proteins. This make Trp-cage a
favorite model miniprotein for folding simulations. Here we will simulate its dynamics:
